# Post'IT - Next.js & React

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app && npm audit fix --force`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Acknowledgment

This project was built by following the “[Next.js 16 Full Course | Build and Deploy a Production-Ready Full Stack App](https://youtu.be/I1V9YWqRIeI)” tutorial of [JavaScript Mastery](https://jsmastery.com/).

I used the course as a foundation to understand the architecture, best practices, and deployment workflow of a full-stack application using Next.js.

While I customized and adapted the features, structure, and logic to fit my own requirements, some parts of the design and layout may look similar to the original tutorial project.

The purpose of this project is to showcase my understanding of full-stack development concepts and my ability to modify and extend an existing architecture to meet specific needs.
